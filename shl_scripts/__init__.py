Learning filters from natural images using sparse coding
========================================================

* When imposing a code representing patches from natural images to be sparse,
one observes the formation of filters ressembling the receptive field of simple
cells in primates primary visual cortex.  This was first proposed in the
framework of the SparseNet algorithm from Bruno Olshausen
(http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/sparsenet/).

* This particular implementation has been published as Perrinet, Neural
Computation (2010) (see https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-10-shl )::
